#Exploratory analysis and Sales Prediction
The data used is video games sales data wherein there are region wise and global sales columns along with features like user_count,User score,etc.
I have tried to do exploratory analysis by creating some visualizations.Then I have built a model for predicting future global sales by using Random Forest regressor.
I have also tried to cluster the games on the basis of multiple features like user count,critic score,publisher etc and target as global sales.
